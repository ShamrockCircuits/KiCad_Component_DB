FAB - Fabrication Component Library

Please check that your device is listed below before adding it to this library.
Check that the component type does not already exist in a different library before adding below.
Consider making an entirely new library before adding a new component type below.

__Supported Component Types__
Fiducials, Tooling Holes, Mouse Bites, Test Points

# Taxonomy
All components share the same base format `CCC-NNN-VVVV`. To help organize this component category, fabrication parts have used the `NNN` digits to classify the mechanical family as described below.

This component library will very likely remain small. For this reason I won't try to catch all possible "types" of fabrication objects. Instead I will do my best to capture the most common types.... 

- `0NN` - SMD Solder Jumper
    - New parts should be added chronologically starting from `FAB-000-0000`

- `1NN` - Fiducials
    - New parts should be added chronologically starting from `FAB-100-0000`

- `2NN` - Tooling Holes
    - New parts should be added chronologically starting from `FAB-200-0000`

- `3NN` - Mouse Bites
    - New parts should be added chronologically starting from `FAB-300-0000`
